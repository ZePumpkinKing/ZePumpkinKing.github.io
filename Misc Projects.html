                Though a smaller project I thought I had a lot of fun with this and wanted to
                showcase it. Given a rigged and animated character, I was tasked with implementing
                said animations in a game setting, and I decided to throw in a little extra flair.
                I created a third person camera setup, as well as a weighted constraint based
                multi-aim rig to have the character look wherever the camera was looking. In the
                process of messing with rig settings, I discovered some fun interactions that allowed
                me to cause the character to ragdoll, and finally, I added some controls to fly
                around while ragdolled.

                Bunker Hill was a solo project, and Treehouse was one third of a group project where
                we learned about level streaming. Both were completed using the same shooter asset
                pack and a lot of custom modeled Unreal geometry. Bunker Hill I based off my
                experience playing Overwatch with a similar layout to Ilios Lighthouse, the bunker
                itself being a point to capture and the trenches a combat zone between it and the
                spawns. With the base layout down a lot of work went into making the various
                sightlines and spaces more interesting with decorative boulders and traps, some
                boxes for climbing out of the trenches, and of course the destroyed tank in
                the center, of which the barrels can be climbed through as a flanking entrance to the
                bunker. Finally I played around with Unreal’s physics settings to make pushable cover
                pillars inside the bunker on a sort of magnet grid. Treehouse has a much simpler
                linear layout, but took a lot more modeling time, the terrain I built for the
                level's background uses a custom 3 layer material, and the terrain sculpt, treehouses, trees, and
                furniture are also all custom made. Both include shortcuts, objectives, and
                health/ammo packs to incentivize out of the way sections, and full accessibility to
                the bot players.
