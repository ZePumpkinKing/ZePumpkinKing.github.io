                Welcome to my software development portfolio! 
                <br><br>
                Below is a collection of projects which I believe
                demonstrate my experience in game engines, programming
                languages, and digital workspaces in general. I have
                provided brief summaries of my work, as well as links
                to their public pages.

                            This was a team project where we were expected to brainstorm and take a game from
                            concept to a playable demo. I was responsible for enemy design, controller setup,
                            and a custom zero gravity movement system. The turrets and modular laser grids were
                            my creations, as well as a prototype wall-jumping turret, and walking enemy, which
                            unfortunately didnâ€™t make it into the final build.

                            Originally a testing ground for my 3D unity ideas, I brought it forward as a basis
                            for another team project. Together with my fellow students, we came up with a
                            fighting game layout, and I was given the task of putting together a player,
                            third person camera system, enemies, and an arena survival setup. The three elemental
                            spells, Fire, Earth, and Water, were my creations as well.

                            For this Game Jam project I was the lead programmer. The whole team collaborated on
                            designing the game itself, however I was tasked with building it, including teaching
                            a team member to work in Unity/Visual Studio to help with the menu UI, and
                            implementing art assets from the rest of the team. My goal for the project was to take
                            a dive into multiplayer setups in Unity, and I spent some time learning about the
                            input system and setting up multiple players with different control devices. I also
                            constructed the final arena using modular tiles, and set up the background and intro
                            scroll animations from static art and sprites.
